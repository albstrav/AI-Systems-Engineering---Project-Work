As oceans become more acidic, organisms that build calcium carbonate shells and skeletons struggle to survive. Coral reefs, shellfish, and plankton are particularly vulnerable. Since marine ecosystems support fisheries that feed billions of people, ocean acidification has significant implications for food security. Reducing carbon emissions is essential to address this problem."," Design feedback mechanisms to keep marine organisms healthy each spring by further reducing carbon dioxide emissions the following two years. Finally, effective environmental stewardship procedures for marine life ensure that family-associated species evolved to survive when scientists now realize how to redirect and mitigate changes in their environment.

Influence of Men's Intelligence and Gender

Apart from World War I and just a few decades' worth of financial and socio-economic depression (by as late as the late 19th century), there are reasons to feel confident that advances in recent science and medicine would revive and refine the progress of a society that feels bored. Some among them are readily clear and not not limited to economists.

Instead, a modest sum of money can generate basic courses in literacy, math and computers, lift middle- school teachers and many others out of first- or second-generation poverty. With it, education could feed at-risk populations.
